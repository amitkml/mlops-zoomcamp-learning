## Business Problem
This is the development of final project for the course mlops-zoomcamp from [DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp/tree/main/07-project).
The project provides the online service for the prediction of customers intention to buy a car. The dataset has been downloaded from kaggle. 
The aim of the project is to make a production service with experiment tracking, pipeline automation, observability and we are not focussed towards accuracy of the model.
## Dataset
The dataset is available from [kaggle House Rent Prediction Dataset
](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/house-rent-prediction-dataset)

## High Level Solution
The project is implemented on Ubuntu 22.04 on Amazon AWS. The described steps for reproducbility are based on specific AWS configuration. This repository has 2 folders: src and data. The folder data contains the whole dataset for the given service. In the folder src the main source code is provided with various configuration files for docker and existing databases.
